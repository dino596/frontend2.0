## Team Agile Manifesto

1. Always work to support one another in a collaborative way.
2. Produce high-quality work and have every team member contribute an equal part.
3. Problem-solve as a group--don't keep problems to oneself.
4. Discuss weekly goals each Monday to ensure we stay on track and meet all our deadlines.
5. Foster a positive working environment and attitude to promote learning and collaboration.
