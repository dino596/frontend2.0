    "## Binary-Decimal Conversion\n",
    "- the calculator would work one way\n",
    "- you input a decimal number and it gives you the binary conversion \n",
    "- we can likely develop our own formula or find a formula, using JavaScript to convert\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Operations\n",
    "- we would have the normal operations of a 4-function calculator \n",
    "- multiplication, division, subtraction, addition\n",
    "- JavaScript\n",

    "## Animation Feature\n",
    "- we would add an animation to the background of the calculator \n",
    "- SASS use\n",
    "- animation ideas include: moving background, interactive buttons (changing color, spinning, lighting up different colors when you hover over them)\n"
