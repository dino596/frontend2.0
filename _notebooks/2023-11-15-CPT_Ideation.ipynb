    "# CPT Mini Project Ideation: Binary Calculator with Animation, Logic Gates, and Bit Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary-Decimal Conversion\n",
    "- the calculator would work one way\n",
    "- you input a decimal number and it gives you the binary conversion \n",
    "- we can likely develop our own formula or find a formula, using JavaScript to convert\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Operations\n",
    "- we would have the normal operations of a 4-function calculator \n",
    "- multiplication, division, subtraction, addition\n",
    "- JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logic Gates\n",
    "- we will insert different logic gates as different buttons on the calculator \n",
    "- they might have a different color when you hover over their buttons to differentiate types of actions ones can conduct on the calculator \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bit Shifts\n",
    "- this would be two buttons\n",
    "- binary left and right shift features on the calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Animation Feature\n",
    "- we would add an animation to the background of the calculator \n",
    "- SASS use\n",
    "- animation ideas include: moving background, interactive buttons (changing color, spinning, lighting up different colors when you hover over them)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Style\n",
    "- 4 different outputs: binary, decimal (also the input), hexadecimal, octal\n",
    "- butttons for different calcualtor features\n",
    "- drop down menu for the logic gates portion \n",
    "\n",
    "## Outside Reserach\n",
    "- will investigate the best methods others have used to execute plans like this\n",
    "- will utilize chatGPT to discover the code we can use to execute our plan\n",
    "- will look at the code for the Calculator from last trimester as an example for our project"
